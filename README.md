## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
(pcap_data_train, pcap_data_test), pcap_ds_info = tfds.load(
    ‘pcap_mnist’, split=[‘train’, ‘test’],
    shuffle_files=True, as_supervised=True, with_info=True,
)
```
